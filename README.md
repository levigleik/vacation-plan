## üíª Getting Started

First of all, you must install the dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

### 1) Creating a .env file

You must create a ```.env``` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

If you want to use Postgresql, you must add the following environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/vacation-plan
```

Remember to change the user and password to your own credentials.

You can also rename the ```.env.example``` to ```.env``` and change the values to your own credentials.


### If you want to simplify, you must follow the next step to use SQLite instead of Postgresql:

Go to ```./prisma/schema.prisma``` and remove this:

```
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("NEXT_DATABASE_URL")
}
```
and add this:
```
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

### 2) Now you run the prisma migrations:

```bash
npm run prisma-migrate
```

### 3) To use a mocked data for testing you must run:

```
npm run seed
```

## üöÄ Running the project

You can start the project using:
```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) with your browser to it running.

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing

If you ran the seed command, you can use the following credentials to login:

```
